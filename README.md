# DroughtTolerance_GenomicandPhenomicSelection
Genome-wide markers and remote sensing technologies have become critical tools to increase the rate of genetic gain in wheat. 
Prediction models trained with genome wide markers or phenomic predictors from multispectral imagery can help breeders better select
or predict for high genetic potential for a trait. Elastic net models trained with a joint dataset of phenomic and genomic predictors 
offers lower prediction error than models with only one dataset , genomic or phenomic, as predictors for yield, protein, and test weight.
